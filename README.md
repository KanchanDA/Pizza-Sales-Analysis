For this project, I played the role of a Data Analyst for a pizza restaurant chain. The objective was to develop an SQL-based solution to analyze key business metrics related to pizza sales. Using SQL Server, I queried the database to extract insights such as total orders, revenue generation, pizza popularity, and sales trends. The project involved joining multiple tables, performing aggregations, and deriving meaningful business insights to support decision-making.
